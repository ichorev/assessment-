Foosa 


Foosa evolved many features similar to cats although much bigger. An average adult is 70 to 80 cm long and they have an average weight of 5.5kg to 8.6 kg. The males tend to be larger than the females. 

Foosa can extend their claws fully but not retract them fully so they have semi-retractable claws. They also have very flexible ankles that allow them to jump up and down trees head first, helping with jumping from tree to tree.
